Simulation of \acs{AVR} programs offers substantial advantages, most notably
zero costs, no hardware requirements, and easy debugging with familiar tools.
For this thesis, a new graphical, extensible \acs{AVR} simulation frontend based
on \simavr and Qt has been developed in C++. This frontend, called \qsimavr,
provides simulation of commonly used \acs{IO} components such as the
\acs{GLCD}, \acs{LCD}, Temperature Sensor, \acs{EEPROM}, \acs{RTC}, \acsp{LED}
and buttons. \qsimavr is now able to execute a large majority
of the tasks and exercises of the \ac{TU} Vienna's Microcontroller lab course.
New components can be easily added through a plugin interface as needed.
