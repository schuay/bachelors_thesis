Simulation of \acs{AVR} programs offers substantial advantages, most notably
zero costs, no hardware requirements, and easy debugging with familiar tools.
For this thesis, a new graphical, extensible \acs{AVR} simulation frontend based
on \emph{simavr} and Qt has been developed. Commonly used components such as the
\acs{GLCD}, \acs{LCD}, Temperature Sensor, \acs{EEPROM}, \acs{RTC}, \acs{LED}s
and buttons have been provided.
