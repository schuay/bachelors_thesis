\noindent Here comes the abstract. The abstract should be about
150 ... 250 words long and contain the following information:\\
{\em What is the subject of this work?}\\
{\em What is the objective of this work?}\\
{\em What were the conclusions you have drawn as a result?}\\
Remember that the abstract should be self-contained, thus does not
have any literature references in its text.
