\chapter{Related Work} \label{chapter:relatedwork}

This chapter should give an overview over existing work that is
related to your work. Instead of \dq{Related Work}, this chapter can
also be named specifically to the topic of the thesis.

For example in Bernhard Weirich's Bachelor's thesis, there are two
chapters on related work named \dq{Time-Driven Algorithms} and
\dq{Event-Driven Algorithms}~\cite{weirich:2005}.

Each related approach should be described by a section of about
100-500 words.

\section{Types of Bachelor's Theses}

If you write a plain report on some implementation, you might have
no chapter on related works.
