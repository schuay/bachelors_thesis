\chapter{Acknowledgements} \label{chapter:acknowledgements}

This thesis has been made possible by the kind help of several people.

First and foremost, I'd like to thank the author of simavr, Michel Pollet, for
the help and many discussions during the past couple of months.

My colleages Mino Sharkhawy and Ondrej Hosek for kindly providing their AVR
applications as testbeds.

Alexander K\"ossler, who has lent valuable assistance whenever I needed it.

And finally, Moni Linke, who has always supported me in everything I do.
