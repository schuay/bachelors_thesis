\chapter{Acknowledgements} \label{chapter:acknowledgements}

This thesis has been made possible by the kind help of several people.

First and foremost, I'd like to thank the author of simavr, Michel Pollet, for
the help and many discussions during the past couple of months. (And of course
for writing simavr, the basis for this thesis!)

The entire open source ecosystem, for making a project like this possible in the
first place. In particular, Martin Thomas (the author of the DS18X20 demo
application), Colin O' Flynn (the author of the CRC routine used by the
temperature sensor), and Winfried Simon (for the QHexEdit widget).

My colleages Mino Sharkhawy and Ondrej Hosek for kindly providing their AVR
applications as testbeds.

Alexander K\"ossler, who has lent valuable assistance whenever I needed it;
together with the entire Microcontroller team at the University of Vienna, for
their support, code, motivation and company last semester.

And finally, Moni Linke, who has always supported me in everything I do.
