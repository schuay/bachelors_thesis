\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chapter:conclusion}

The chapter \dq{Conclusion}, sometimes also named \dq{Summary}
should contain two things:

\emph{Main contribution(s) of this work} -- Why is the world a
better one now ;-)

When you write the conclusion, assume that some quick readers might
not have gone through the whole thesis but are merely peeking into
the conclusion, therefore avoid complicated nomenclature here.

\emph{Outlook} -- what could be the next steps or possible
extensions for this research?
