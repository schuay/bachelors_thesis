\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chapter:conclusion}

\qsimavr fills a gap in the open source ecosystem of \ac{AVR} utilities by
providing a simple way of simulating \ac{AVR} microcontrollers including
external periphery. The application is simple to use, and full documentation is
provided for \qsimavr and \simavr internals.

Components are implemented using a plugin architecture with a well documented
interface and numerous examples, allowing for easy extensibility by interested parties.
All components can include graphical output and accept input
from the user.

Furthermore, \ac{VCD} trace files can be produced during execution
which substantially aids development and debugging of hardware drivers.

\ac{GDB} debugging is also supported through the use of the \ac{GDB} Remote Serial
Protocol, allowing developers to use established debugging tools they are already
familiar with.

\qsimavr provides simulation for eight components that should cover
all base use cases of the BIGAVR6 board. If required, further components such
as external Bluetooth and Ethernet modules could be implemented as follow-up projects.
